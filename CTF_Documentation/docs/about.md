# About This Project

## Purpose

The CTF was created as a way to allow users to practice and hone skills realated to Industrial Control Systems. The CTF can be explored and worked on during a user's down-time, and will provide an at-will training ground to sharpen skills related to ICS environments.

## Authors

This CTF was created by Judd Morse and Matthew Chopek, as part of their WCC Capstone Project.

## Structure

The Documentation for this project is first grouped by category. Within the categories are the individual challenge questions. Each challenge question is written out, along with a full breakdown of how the challenge question was solved. It should be noted that there are almost certainly alternate methods for solving each problem; the provided solution is simply that which was used by the authors.

## Tools

Tools and resources used for this CTF are collected and catalogued after the structure. A brief description for each tool used is provided, as well as a download link whenvever possible.
